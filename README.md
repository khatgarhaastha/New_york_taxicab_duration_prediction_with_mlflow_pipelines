# New York Taxi Cab Duration Prediction: Advanced Machine Learning Pipeline

## Project Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository containing a detailed Jupyter Notebook showcasing an advanced machine learning (ML) pipeline for predictive analysis. This project encompasses the entire workflow of a sophisticated ML model, from data loading to preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions.

## Notebook Structure
The notebook is organized into several key technical sections, each playing a crucial role in the ML pipeline:

1. **Loading the Data**:
   - This section involves importing the dataset into the Python environment. It details the data source, format, and initial steps for ingesting data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Here, we conduct an initial exploration to understand the dataset's characteristics. It includes visualizations, summary statistics, and identifying data inconsistencies.
   - The preprocessing phase involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization techniques to prepare the dataset for ML models.

3. **Modeling Pipeline**:
   - The core of the notebook, this section details the construction of the ML pipeline. It includes:
     - **Feature Selection**: Techniques used to select the most relevant features for the model.
     - **Model Training**: Steps to train various machine learning models, such as decision trees, ensemble methods, or neural networks.
     - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Process of optimizing model parameters for best performance.
     - **Cross-Validation**: Techniques used to validate the model's performance on unseen data.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Focuses on evaluating the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

5. **Prediction and Analysis**:
   - This section involves using the trained model to make predictions on new data.


### **The machine learning algorithms used in the project to make predictions include:**

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - A fundamental statistical approach used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's used for prediction in cases where the relationship is linear.

2. **Random Forest Regressor**:
   - An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training. It outputs the mean prediction of the individual trees for regression tasks.

3. **Pipelines with GridSearchCV**:
   - The notebook employs scikit-learn pipelines combined with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. This method systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validating as it goes to determine which tune gives the best performance.

4. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**:
   - PCA is used for dimensionality reduction in the preprocessing steps, reducing the feature space's dimensionality while retaining most of the data's variability.

5. **Use of MLflow**:
   - MLflow is used for managing the machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.

These algorithms collectively represent a comprehensive approach to predictive modeling, covering a range of techniques from simple linear models to complex ensemble methods and dimensionality reduction techniques. The choice of algorithms indicates a balance between interpretability (like linear regression) and model performance (like Random Forest). The use of MLflow suggests an emphasis on experiment tracking and model management.
